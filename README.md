# React Gallery App

This is a simple interactive image gallery built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features

- Displays a gallery of three high-resolution images.
- Click on any image to view it in a large modal overlay.
- Click the enlarged image or press the `Escape` key to close the modal.

## Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

## How it Works

- The app displays a horizontal gallery of three images.
- Clicking an image opens it in a modal overlay at a larger size.
- Clicking the large image or pressing the **Escape** key closes the modal.
